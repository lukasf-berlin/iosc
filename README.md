# iosc

A Windows native iOS toolchain for *personal use*. Compile Swift, link, bundle, sign, and install onto an iPhone entirely without a Mac.

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
- The Windows Swift toolchain, which gives us the compiler: <https://www.swift.org/install/windows/>
- Apple Mobile Device Support, required to install the app on a phone (building, signing and packaging work without it): <https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9np83lwlpz9k>. Alternatively, iTunes also works.
- MinGW-w64, for `g++` on your PATH. Builds the ADI native bridge used for free Apple ID signing: <https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/>
- Visual Studio Build Tools, with the C++ workload and the Windows SDK. Builds the Swift macro plugins that make SwiftUI and SwiftData work: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/> (you do not need full Visual Studio).

Build the executable:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; .\packaging\build.ps1
```

This creates `dist\iosc.exe`. Add it to your PATH, or move the executable wherever you prefer. Then run:

```powershell
iosc toolchain status
```

The command will tell you what is set up and what's missing. Follow its instructions to install the rest of the prerequisites.

## Quick Start

1. Run `iosc toolchain status` to see which dependencies are missing, and follow its instructions to install them.
2. Run `iosc auth login <apple_id>`. It will prompt you for your password, followed by the verification code sent to your iPhone.
3. Run `iosc init` to create the `Sources/` directory. Place your Swift project files there.
4. Run `iosc build` to create the compiled app.
5. Run `iosc sign --apple-id <apple_id>` to sign the app with your certificate.
6. Run `iosc install` to install the app on the connected iPhone.

### Location of external files

Everything you are asked to move lies in an `external` directory. `iosc` picks one of these locations, in order:

1. `%IOSC_EXTERNAL%`, if you set it.
2. `external` beside `iosc.exe`, if that directory exists.
3. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\iosc\external` otherwise.

Note: to use a custom location, either put `external` next to `iosc.exe` or set `%IOSC_EXTERNAL%`.

`iosc toolchain status` prints which of the three locations it picked, and `iosc dev paths` prints the absolute path decided on for every asset.

### Linking a system library

Apple SDK frameworks go into the `frameworks` list in `iosc.toml` by their exact name. 
System libraries like SQLite are passed directly to the linker. Create a `linker_flags` list and pass whatever the linker expects:

```toml
linker_flags = ["-lsqlite3"]
```

### Reading file:line in a crash report

`iosc build` writes a `.dSYM` bundle next to the built app. Point `iosc crash symbolicate` at it with `--dsym`, alongside `--binary` for the app:

```powershell
iosc crash symbolicate report.ips --binary build/Demo.app/Demo --dsym build/Demo.dSYM
```

This resolves each stack frame to a source file and line number.

## Commands

Every command also accepts `--project <dir>` (defaults to the current directory), `--verbose`, and `--json`.

```text
iosc init                      write an iosc.toml for the current project
    --name <name>                  app name, defaults to the project folder name
    --bundle-id <id>               reverse DNS bundle id, defaults to com.example.<name>

iosc sdk extract <xip>          unpack required SDK out of a .xip
    --no-resume                    do not resume a partial extraction, start over

iosc sdk status                 report whether the SDK is present and usable

iosc sdk verify                 check the extracted SDK against its expected layout

iosc auth login <apple_id>      sign in with an Apple ID to get a signing identity
                                 (will then prompt you for your password, and the code
                                 sent to your device)
    --anisette <source>            where to get anisette data from, default "local"
                                    local     generate it on this machine from external files placed during setup
                                    <url>     fetch it from a remote anisette server
                                    remote    same as a url, passed separately
                                    file      read it from a captured file
                                    static    use a fixed, hardcoded set of headers

iosc auth status <apple_id>     show the signing identity cached for an Apple ID

iosc auth apk-extract [apkm]    pull ADI libraries out of the Apple Music apkm in
                                 external/apk (or the given path), needed once before
                                 'iosc auth login --anisette local' will work

    --apple-id <id>                Apple ID to derive a signing identity from
    --team-id <id>                 team id to use when the Apple ID has more than one
    --revoke-and-reissue           revoke the existing certificate and get a new one
    --force                        sign even if a valid signature already exists

iosc package                    bundle the signed .app into an installable .ipa

iosc devices                    list iOS devices attached over USB

iosc install                    install the built app onto a device
    --udid <udid>                  device to install onto, default the first attached one

iosc log                        stream the device syslog
    --udid <udid>                  device to stream from
    --contains <text>              only show lines containing this text
    --os-log                       read from os_log instead of the plain syslog
    --pid <pid>                    only show lines from this process id
    --process-name <name>          only show lines from this process name
    --match <text>                 extra filter text, repeatable

iosc crash list                 list crash reports stored on the device
    --udid <udid>                  device to list from
    --remote-path <path>           directory on the device to list, default "/"
    --depth <n>                    how many directory levels to recurse, default 1

iosc crash pull <out>           copy crash reports off the device
    --udid <udid>                  device to pull from
    --remote-path <path>           directory on the device to pull from, default "/"

    --erase                        delete the reports off the device after pulling

iosc crash symbolicate <report> resolve addresses in a crash report to source
    --binary <path>                binary to resolve symbols against, repeatable
    --dsym <path>                  a .dSYM bundle to also resolve file:line from, repeatable
    --thread <n>                   only symbolicate this thread

iosc clean                      remove build output for the current project

iosc dev <probe>                inspect internal state; probes are sdk, toolchain,
                                 device, paths, tunnel
```

Note: `iosc init` creates an empty `Sources/` directory next to `iosc.toml`. Put your `.swift` files there before building.

### Planned commands

```text
iosc launch                     start an installed app on the device (planned)
    --udid <udid>                  device to launch on
    --env <KEY=VALUE>              environment variable to set, repeatable
    --no-kill-existing             do not kill a running instance first
    --suspended                    launch stopped, waiting for a debugger
    -- <args>                      everything after -- is passed to the app untouched

iosc run                        build, sign, install, and optionally launch in one step (planned)
                                 (takes every flag `iosc sign` takes, plus)
    --no-log                       do not stream the log after install
    --launch                       also launch the app after install
```

For now, launch the app by tapping it on the device.

Run `iosc --help` or `iosc <command> --help` for full details on any command.

## What you need to bring

You need to bring the proprietary software yourself. By default, it is expected to be placed inside `external/`.

### `external/xcode`

Extracted from an Xcode `.xip` you download from Apple with your own developer account:

```powershell
iosc sdk extract path\to\Xcode.xip
iosc sdk status
```

### `external/apple_certs`

Two public certificates, published by Apple on their Certificate Authority page at <https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/>.

Download both files and place them in `external/apple_certs`:

- `AppleWWDRCAG3.cer`
- `AppleIncRootCertificate.cer`

Direct download: append the file name to `https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/`.

### `external/tools`

A different `ld64.lld` is required. `iosc` will fetch this automatically from LLVM's release:

```powershell
iosc toolchain fetch
iosc toolchain status
```

### `external/apk`

Only needed for `iosc auth login --anisette local` (the default). Download an Apple Music v6.5.2 `.apkm`, move it to this path, then run:

```powershell
iosc auth apk-extract
iosc toolchain status
```

## Capabilities and Limitations

### Capabilities

- SwiftUI and SwiftData _mostly_ work. 38 of 47 Swift macros have been reimplemented. Most of the unimplemented ones are internal and unreachable:
  - `EntryDefaultValueMacro`, `AnimatableValuesDataMacro`, `AnimatablePairDataMacro`
  - `AnimatableValuesDataPropertyMacro`, `AnimatablePairDataPropertyMacro`
  - `SessionPropertyEntryDefaultValueMacro`, `Previewable`, `RuleMacro`
- UIKit apps via storyboards and XIBs. You have to write the XML by hand, sorry.
- Asset catalogs
- Code signing with a paid developer account, or a free one
- Packaging to `.app` and `.ipa`
- Device installation
- Syslog streaming
- Crash reports

### Limitations

- No IDE, visual editor, SwiftUI canvas, or preview
- No debugger
- No simulator (yet)
- No Swift Package Manager (next item on the to-do list)
- No XCTest equivalent/support
- No Core Data: use SwiftData instead
- No App Intents (`@AppEntity` is not complete as of now), so no Shortcuts or Siri
- No App Store or TestFlight submission (you should probably get a Mac if you want to publish your app)
- No extensions, watchOS, macOS, etc. No widgets
- No Metal shaders
- Macros tested on an iPhone: `@State`, `@Model`, `@Query`, `@Relationship`, `@Attribute`, `@Transient`, `#Unique`, `#Index`, `@ModelActor`, `@Entry`, `@Animatable`, `@AnimatableIgnored`, `@Parameter`
- Macros that compile but are untested (use at your own risk): `@Bindable`, `@Observable`, `@Environment`, `@AppStorage`, `@SceneStorage`, `@FocusState`, `@Namespace`, `@Preview`

## Development

`.\iosc.cmd` runs without building anything (for local testing). Its first run creates a `.venv` beside it and installs `iosc` into that virtual environment. It reads `external` from this directory rather than from `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.
